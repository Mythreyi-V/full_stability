# Evaluation of Explanation Stability for Tabular Data
The code and documents contained in this repository supplement the PhD thesis "Evaluating Post Hoc Explanations Using Tabular Data: A Functionally-Grounded Approach" (publication forthcoming).

Some code used in this repository is sourced from <a href="https://github.com/irhete/predictive-monitoring-benchmark">the outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring benchmark</a> and <a href="https://github.com/renuka98/interpretable_predictive_processmodel/tree/master/BPIC_Data">a previous work on interpreting this benchmark</a>. We thank the authors of the benchmark on outcome oriented predictions, for providing the source code which enabled further study on the interpretability of the models. In addition to this, <a href="https://github.com/nogueirs/JMLR2018">a module developed to measure stability of feature subsets is used</a>.
